# Storytime :books:

## Project Overview
The Storytime project is a basic website which takes user input to form a story. The application is based off of a Treehouse Tutorial which can be accessed [here](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/variables-and-strings-challenge). This is also a part of my 1<sup>st</sup> round of the **100 Days of Code Challenge**.

## Inital Work
